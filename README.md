## My process


### What I learned

I started with a simple project to get use to front-end mentor and practice some basic HTML/CSS. Was a good practice of using Git again too and GitHub Pages. 

### Continued development

Going to continue with a sligtly harder project to continue practicing the HTML and CSS basics.
